# Pear Tutoring App WIP

## What is this repo?

This is a fork of the official Pear Tutoring app repo. This fork is meant to serve as a demo of the basic 'skeleton' of the Pear Tutoring app that is currently under development, and provide some context surrounding the basic architecture and technologies used.

## What is Pear Tutoring?
Pear Tutoring is an online tutoring service that pairs (get it, like the fruit üçê) students with the tutors that fit their needs best. Our goal is to make a simple process that cuts through the BS - we want to create a flow where students can enter their basic needs and get paired with a qualified tutor in minutes. Most services out there ask a ridiculous number of questions or require students to reach out to tutors directly, not to mention they charge obsurd fees. We are looking to establish a low, affordable rate for all tutors, and give them 90% commission. 

## Why make a public fork? Is this not a _'stealth'_ startup?? ü§î
We are in very early stages of development and I wanted to have a point of reference for anyone interested in the project! We are using the T3 stack as a foundation for the app, which presents some exciting opportunities to work with really cool tech like tRPC and Tailwind CSS. Is it a security risk to open-source any of this code? Nope! I'm a big believer in building in public early on. There's nothing sensitive in this repo as again, this is a carefully curated fork.  

## How do I join the project?
So happy you're interested! Shoot me an email at matia1606@gmail.com if you're interested in working on the project and we'll be in touch üòÄ
